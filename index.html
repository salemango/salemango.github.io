                    <h3>Hello! Here's a bit about me.</h3>
                    <p>I’m a web designer and developer who believes that every design is a work of art. 
                       I specialize in modern layouts that use a range of design principles in order to make a final product that is as functional as it is beautiful. 
                       In my work, I focus on bringing my artistic experience and intuition to the world of web design to enhance the visual and practical experience of each design I create.
                       </p>
                    <h3>But it doesn't end there.</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I find joy in a range of artistic mediums, both digital and traditional. I've had a passion for creating art since I was a toddler, and almost two decades of experience have shaped my ability to intuitively understand the best choices when creating a design with both personality and practicality.

                        <li>I was tasked with creating a website for a hypothetical client in Raleigh, NC. This client was a nursery whose brand identity focused on community and sustainability.</li>
                        <li>I sculpted the website from the ground up. This was a solo project, so I handled everything in its design and development, from the first wireframes to writing and finalizing the code at the end. The only thing I didn't make myself was the website's copy, which was provided for me.</li>
                        <li>The end result was a clean and welcoming design that uses color theory and design principles to its advantage in order to let the brand's personality shine.</li>

                        <li>This project was a personal experiment on my own time. I wanted to see if I could use jQuery (along with normal JavaScript) to build a "name generator".</li>
                        <li>The code for this project was handwritten by me and, due to its experimental nature, the algorithm used to generate the names is the result of my own problem-solving.</li>
                        <li>The name generator works by generating alternating vowels and consonants in order to create (mostly) pronouncable "names". The user can save the generated names or delete them from their saved list both in bulk and individually.</li>

                        <li>This project uses JavaScript and an HTML form to allow a user to build a meal planner for the following week based on the meals that they type in. From these inputs, a planner is automatically built and displayed in a new window. The user also has the option to print the resulting planner.</li>
                        <li>The custom-built planner is left mostly unstyled to allow for easy printing and readability.</li>
                        <li>'Build Your Meal Planner' was created as a final project for a beginner JavaScript course in which I had to show off everything that I had learned.</li>

                        <li>For this project, I concepted an app that would help artists sell their artwork and network in their local communities. All of Artconnect's elements (except for the stock photos) were all created by me as a solo project using Figma's prototype feature.</li>
                        <li>Over the course of the project, I first created the low fidelity prototype and then moved on to refining it based on the feedback I was given.</li>
                        <li>The app's target audience was mostly comprised of creatives and prospective buyers who would otherwise sell and post their work on another platform. Because of this, the design mimics the layout of many social media apps, especially Instagram.</li>
